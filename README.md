## Interpreting and evaluating Bayesian source-reliability models

This model, which I wrote for my Master's thesis at the MCMP, puts eight agents to the task of determining the reliability of an advisor via expectation-based updating on multiple rounds of testimony. It is similar to the model used by Hahn et al. (2018) & Merdes et al. (2021) in that it places these focal agents in a situation without any direct access to actual outcomes. Inspired by Duijf (2021), my model disentangles reliability into comptency and alignment and evaluates agents in terms of their trustworthiness-accuracies in addition to their (change in) veritistic values (Goldman 1999). The Boolean *BH*-model was introduced Bovens & Hartmann (2004), the continuous *OL*-model by Olsson (2011) & Angere (2010), the Boolean *AL*-model by Assaad (2022) & Harris et al. (2016), and in creatinng the *SD*-model I was again inspired by Duijf (2021).
